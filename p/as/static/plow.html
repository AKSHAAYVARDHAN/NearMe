    <h1>The Plow</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <i> Plow is a San Francisco restaurant serving farm to table comfort food in a bright and friendly neighbourhood space

        In 2010, Charles and Treena Fiesel purchased a farm in Madison, with a dream of living off the land.  In pursuit of this dream, the Fiesels opened PLOW in October 2015, launching a mission of providing farm-to-table food in the heart of downtown Cambridge.
        
        Our goal is to be directly connected to as much of the food served here as possible. Much of the food you will eat comes directly from the family farm; from the seasonally fresh-picked vegetables, to the pork and lamb to beef butchered since 2017. The pork from our farm is a special heritage cross mix, and the lamb is a Katahdin, raised to create the best flavor. We sincerely hope you enjoy the warm atmosphere, friendly service and the delicious food we strive to consistentlyÂ provide. </i> </p>
