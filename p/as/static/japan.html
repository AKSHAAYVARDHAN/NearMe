    <h1>Japan Town </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <i> Twin Peaks is one of San Francisco’s best-known landmarks, rising more than 900 feet above sea level near the very center of town. Twin Peaks Boulevard, the only road to the top, is open to vehicles from its southern end and forms an asphalt-covered figure-eight around the two hump-like summits, leading to a parking lot and vista point.

        That frequently visited spot, with its unobstructed views of at least seven Bay Area counties, has an unusual name: Christmas Tree Point. As with the cities of Santa Claus, Indiana, or North Pole, Alaska, it seems like reindeer must live up there.</i> </p>
