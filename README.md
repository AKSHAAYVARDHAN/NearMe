    <h1>The Plow</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <i> Plow is a San Francisco restaurant serving farm to table comfort food in a bright and friendly neighbourhood space

        In 2010, Charles and Treena Fiesel purchased a farm in Madison, with a dream of living off the land.  In pursuit of this dream, the Fiesels opened PLOW in October 2015, launching a mission of providing farm-to-table food in the heart of downtown Cambridge.
        
        Our goal is to be directly connected to as much of the food served here as possible. Much of the food you will eat comes directly from the family farm; from the seasonally fresh-picked vegetables, to the pork and lamb to beef butchered since 2017. The pork from our farm is a special heritage cross mix, and the lamb is a Katahdin, raised to create the best flavor. We sincerely hope you enjoy the warm atmosphere, friendly service and the delicious food we strive to consistently provide. </i> </p>

    <h1>The Painted Ladies</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <i> In American architecture, painted ladies are Victorian and Edwardian houses and buildings repainted, starting in the 1960s, in three or more colors that embellish or enhance their architectural details. The term was first used for San Francisco Victorian houses by Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen in their 1978 book Painted Ladies: San Francisco's Resplendent Victorians.[1] Although polychrome decoration was common in the Victorian era, the colors used on these houses are not based on historical precedent.[2]

        Since then, the term has also been used to describe groups of colorfully repainted Victorian houses in other American cities, such as the Charles Village neighborhood in Baltimore; Lafayette Square in St. Louis; the greater San Francisco and New Orleans areas, in general; Columbia-Tusculum in Cincinnati; the Old West End in Toledo, Ohio; the neighborhoods of McKnight and Forest Park in Springfield, Massachusetts; and the city of Cape May, New Jersey.[3][4][5] They also exist internationally, for example in New Zealand's capital city Wellington.[6]</i> </p>

    <h1>Japan Town </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <i> Twin Peaks is one of San Francisco’s best-known landmarks, rising more than 900 feet above sea level near the very center of town. Twin Peaks Boulevard, the only road to the top, is open to vehicles from its southern end and forms an asphalt-covered figure-eight around the two hump-like summits, leading to a parking lot and vista point.

        That frequently visited spot, with its unobstructed views of at least seven Bay Area counties, has an unusual name: Christmas Tree Point. As with the cities of Santa Claus, Indiana, or North Pole, Alaska, it seems like reindeer must live up there.</i> </p>

    <h1>The Golden Gate Park</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <i> Golden Gate Park is an urban park between the Richmond and Sunset districts of San Francisco, California, United States. It is the second-largest park in the city, containing 1,017 acres (412 ha), and the third-most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 24 million visitors annually.

        The creation of a large park in San Francisco was first proposed in the 1860s. In 1865, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted proposed a park designed with species native to San Francisco. The plan was rejected for a Central Park-style park designed by engineer William Hammond Hall. The park was built atop shore and sand dunes in an unincorporated area known as the Outside Lands. Construction centered on planting trees and non-native grasses to stabilize the dunes that covered three-quarters of the park. The park opened in 1870.</i> </p>

    <h1>Asian Art Museum</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <i> The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco – Chong-Moon Lee Center for Asian Art and Culture[1] is a museum in San Francisco, California that specializes in Asian art. It was founded by Olympian Avery Brundage in the 1960s and has more than 18,000 works of art in its permanent collection, some as much as 6,000 years old.[2] Its logo is an upside down letter A, which also looks like a letter V with a line through it.</i> </p>
